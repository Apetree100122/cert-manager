# This vuln affects malicious helm charts using DNS
# Fixing this requires a huge amount of upgrades because the underlying helm upgrade itself
# had so many dependencies.
# The vulnerability is likely to be more dangerous in the underlying Helm tool which we can
# upgrade, but the library dependency doesn't seem worth it to upgrade.
