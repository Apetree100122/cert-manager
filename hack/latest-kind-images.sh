# This script was used to update kind images, but Kind specifically discourages that
# saying that:
# > NOTE: You must use the @sha256 digest to guarantee an image built for this release,
# > until such a time as we switch to a different tagging scheme.
# > Even then we will highly encourage digest pinning for security and reproducibility reasons.
#
# This script was fatally flawed and has been removed. Maintain make/kind_images.sh by hand, instead.
